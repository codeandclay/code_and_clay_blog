SQL keywords are capatalized. SQL statements are terminated with a `;`.

## `SELECT`

Select all columns from a table:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors;
```

Select a single column from a table:
```
SELECT LastName FROM Authors;
```

Retrieve a list of all different values in a column:
```
SELECT DISTINCT LastName FROM Authors;
```

## `WHERE`

Retrieve row where column matches:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Language = 'English';
```

Retrieve a row where the column does not match:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE NOT Language = 'English';
```

Multiple conditions where all must match:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors
WHERE Language = 'English'
AND LastName = 'Hardinge';
```

Multiple conditions where either must match:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors
WHERE Language = 'English'
OR LastName = 'Garner';
```

## `ORDER BY`

Order the result:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors ORDER BY LastName;
```

Return the result in reverse order:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors ORDER BY LastName DESC;
```

Order the result alphabetically by last name then language:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors ORDER BY LastName, Language;
```

## `INSERT`

Insert a new row into a table:
```
INSERT INTO Authors (
    LastName,
    Language
)
VALUES (
    'Jansson',
    'Swedish'
);
```

## `NULL`

Select a row with an empty column:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE DateOfDeath IS NULL;
```

Select a row where a specified column is not empty:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE DateOfDeath IS NOT Null;
```


## `UPDATE`

Update a column in all rows:
```
UPDATE Authors SET Published = 'true';
```

Update only specific columns (I'm stretching the example a bit now):
```
UPDATE Authors SET Read = 'true' WHERE Published = 'true';
```

Update multiple columns:
```
UPDATE Authors
SET Read = 'true',
Published = 'true',
WHERE AuthorId = 23;
```

## `DELETE`

Delete rows:
```
DELETE FROM Authors WHERE Published = 'false';
```

Delete all rows:
```
DELETE FROM Authors;
```

## Functions

Select the smallest value:
```
SELECT MIN(Titles) FROM Authors;
```

Select the highest value:
```
SELECT MAX(Titles) FROM Authors;
```

Return the count of rows that have `Titles` set to `3`:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Authors WHERE Titles = 3;
```

Calculate an average:
```
SELECT AVG(Books) FROM Authors;
```

Sum all the values of a column:
```
SELECT SUM(Books) FROM Authors;
```

Select all the records where the given column starts with a given letter:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE 'A%';
```

Select all the records where the given column ends with a letter:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE '%s';
```

Select all the records where a given column contains a given letter:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE '%d';
```

Select all rows where a given column starts and ends with the given letters:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE 'A%s';
```

Select all rows where a given column does not start with the given letter:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName NOT LIKE `A%`;
```

Select all rows where the second letter of a column is a given letter:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE ' l%';
```

Select all rows where the first letter of a column begins with one of the given letters:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE '[ABC]%';
```

Select all rows where the first letter of a column falls within an inclusive range:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE '[A-F]%';
```

Select all rows where the first letter of a column does begin with one of:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName LIKE '[!A-F]%';
```

## `IN`

Select rows where a column matches:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName IN ('Aldiss', 'Ballard');
```

Select rows where a country does not match:
```
SELECT Authors WHERE LastName NOT IN ('Archer', 'Jonker');
```

Select all rows where column value falls within an numerical range:
```
SELECT * Authors WHERE Titles BETWEEN 5 AND 10
```

Select all rows where column value does not fall within a numerical range:
```
SELECT * Authors WHERE Titles NOT BETWEEN 5 AND 10
```

Select all rows where the column name falls within an alphabetical range:
```
SELECT * Authors WHERE LastName BETWEEN 'Cooper' AND 'Masefield';
```

## `ALIAS`

Display column under a different name:
```
SELECT LastName, Books, Language AS Lang FROM Authors;
```

Display a table under a different name:
```
SELECT * FROM Authors AS Writers;
```

## `JOIN`

A `JOIN` is done `ON` something.

Join two tables using the AuthorID field:
```
SELECT *
FROM Publishers
LEFT JOIN Authors
ON Publishers.AuthorID=Authors.AuthorID;
```

Select intersection:
```
SELECT *
FROM Publishers
INNER JOIN Authors
ON Publishers.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID;
```

Select all of one table plus all that matches in another:
```
SELECT * 
FROM Publishers
RIGHT JOIN Authors
ON Publishers.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID;
```

## `GROUP BY`

List the number of authors by language:
```
SELECT COUNT(AuthorID)
Language
From Authors
GROUP BY Language;
```

List number of authors by language, ordered by language with most authors first:
```
SELECT COUNT(AuthorID)
Language
FROM Authors
GROUP BY Language
ORDER BY COUNT(AuthorID) DESC;
```

## SQL
Create a db:
```
CREATE DATABASE db;
```

Drop a db:
```
DROP DATABASE db;
```

Create a table:
```
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    AuthorID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    Language varchar(255)
);
```

Drop a table:
```
DROP TABLE Authors;
```

Delete all rows within a table:
```
TRUNCATE TABLE Authors;
```

Add a column:
