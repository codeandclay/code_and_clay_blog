title: RESTful user intentions
---
Thinking about how an app presents itself to the user as RESTful is good. But I want the user to throw mud at the app and breaking that into the same RESTful actions I have in mind when thinking about the interaction between the controller and the model is making my head hurt.

I've ended up with a UI that looks like it was built by a programmer.
