Object has a curious method named `#itself`. It returns the object it's called on:

```ruby
"Hello".itself
=> "Hello"
```

What could _that_ possibly be used for?

Here's one application:

```ruby
> [1,1,2,3,3,3,4,5,5,6].group_by(&:itself)
=> {1=>[1, 1], 2=>[2], 3=>[3, 3, 3], 4=>[4], 5=>[5, 5], 6=>[6]}
```
