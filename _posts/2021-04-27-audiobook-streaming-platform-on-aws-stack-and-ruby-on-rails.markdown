Piotr discusses how he implemented an [audiobook streaming site in Rails](https://rubywizards.com/series/audiobook-streaming), along with the challenges he faced.

Audiobooks tend to take up a lot of disk space so often streaming is the only practical method of delivery. Piotr writes about using AWS to convert MP3s and using Cloudfront to handle the streaming.
